This little plugin is in homage to my geek friends who love to hate Lord Vader. 

== Description ==

This little plugin is in homage to my geek friends who love to hate Lord Vader. When activated you will randomly see a quote from <cite>Darth Vader's IMDB page in the upper right of your admin screen on every page. HT to Matt Mullenberg for the original code.

== Installation ==


1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Presto. Enjoy. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this show on the front end of my website? =

No, it is only visible to those who have access to see the wp-admin areas of the site.

= I don't see any options, can I make any changes to this plugin? =
Just like the original Hello, Dolly plugin there is not an options panel. Perhaps in a later version, but not right now. 

= Can I customize the look/feel of this plugin via CSS? =
Yes, the quotes are wrapped in the tag, #darth. I'd suggest changing the CSS in your theme's CSS as opposed to the plugins hello_darth.php file.
